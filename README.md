This is a very basic crawler to crawl thoroughbred horse data from the database of netkeiba. 
There was no robots.txt so I kept the requests spacing interval to be 1 sec and so far I haven't have the need to spoof the ip of the crawler. The data crawled is strictly for the mock horse racing game that I am working on not for commercial use. Currently I only collect the horse's name, sex, fur color, born year, it's id on netkeiba, sire, dam.
